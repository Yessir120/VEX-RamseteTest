# VEX Ramsete

This project uses a nonlinear state-space feedback controller (aka. Ramsete) to provide accurate and precise path following. It uses [PROS](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/). 

For path generation, the project uses [Pathplanner](https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner). For position tracking, the project uses [Okapilib's](https://github.com/OkapiLib/OkapiLib) odometry.
